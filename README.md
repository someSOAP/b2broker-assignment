#B2Broker assignment


## Project structure
This is a monorepo project consisted of the following workspaces: 
`b2broker-nextjs` - catalog containing all code written intentionally for this assignment. 
`b2broker-strapi` - autogenerated Strapi project used for CMS integration. Also contains all test data.   

##  How to dun
Install the dependencies from the root catalog
`yarn install` and then run `yarn dev` to launch both nextjs and strapi projects.
You don't need to import any data to strapi project and generating any API keys, all data was commited to this repo,
in order to simplify the process of running and testing this project.  

## Strapi Admin credentials
Email: `test@admin.com`\
Password: `TestAdmin123`

## Project details
This project is integrated with Strapi CMS. All articles and comments to them are stored on the CMS side. Image optimization
is also conducted by Strapi side, so `Image` component from NextJS was not used. Project does not support any kind of authentication. 
NextJS part was written using app router. Usually, I keep components and utils which are related only to specific page,
somewhere inside this page catalog, but for app router (and this small project exactly) I kept almost everything in catalogs 
for shared utils, components and so on (`@/components`, `@/utils`).

In this project integration with Strapi is conducted by server api only, in order not to expose strapi api token to the 
client side. All this methods are described in `strapi-api` catalog. 

If client need to somehow affect strapi data (add a comment to an article) then `client-api` sends request to the nextjs 
api described in `app/api`.

### Main page
I've tried to make main page with infinite scroll and lazy loading but without virtualization as the main page of Medium.com.
Also I've tried to make this page SEO friendly, by providing ability to load chunks of articles by invisible a tag placed in
the bottom of the page `<a className="sr-only" href={'/?lastId=${lastArticleId}'}>`.

Ref: (https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2014/02/infinite-scroll-search-friendly)[Google Infinite Scroll Search Friendly].

### Article page `/article/[id]`
Nothing very interesting here, except comments section. I've made this section client-only, in order to 
avoid crawling comments by search bots. It maybe doubtable decision, I've just made it to have at least some client-only 
part of the application. 

If we try to get to the article which does not exist by providing wrong id (`article/foobar`) we will see 404 page. 
Also we can see global 404 page if we try to reach any other unexisting page.  

### Styling
For this project I used TailwindCss which can come out of the box for the modern versions of NextJS. 
It was quite challenging for me because I've never used this CSS framework before. It was hyped at the time 
when I was focused on mobile development, so it passed me somehow. I hope that my Tailwind writings won't 
disappoint you much. 

### Error handling and positive scenarios
Any error handling and "`useOptimistic`" was omitted in this project, because there were no requirements about it in assignment and in order to reduce 
development time. 

### SEO and optimizations
All pages are SSR, except comments sections, as mentioned above. I've tried to follow the good HTML semantic practised, as
I could remember all HTML tags after years of mobile development. Meta tags was populated only with `title` and `description` fields. 
Responsive image loading was provided by `<picture>` tag, described in `@/components/Image.tsx`.  
Sitemap generation was omitted in order to reduce time of development.

### Thanks
Thanks for such interesting test assignment, it was quite an interesting journey for me to touch web again after 
years of mobile development. I'm glad that my favourite web framework NextJS reached new heights of a popularity and 
lives through such a fantastic updates.
